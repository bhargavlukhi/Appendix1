   1. Title: Broker-based Cross-Cloud Federation Manager
   Author(s): J.B. Abdo, J. Demerjian, H. Chaouchi, K. Barbar, G. Pujolle
   Affiliation(s): Sorbonne University, France; Lebanese University, Lebanon
   Abstract: This paper proposes a broker-based cross-cloud federation manager that enables the creation of a virtual cloud infrastructure by federating 
   multiple cloud providers. The proposed system provides a unified interface for managing resources across multiple clouds, enabling users to deploy and 
   manage applications in a seamless manner.

# Zero Trust Security in Cloud Computing [ Khyati Parmar - 2308312 ]
Title: Establishing a Zero Trust Strategy in Cloud Computing Environment

Abstract: Cloud computing has become an essential technology for businesses and organizations to store, process, and manage data. However, security and privacy challenges have emerged as major concerns in cloud computing. Traditional trust management mechanisms are no longer sufficient to address these challenges. This paper proposes a conceptual zero trust strategy for cloud services, exploring the importance and challenges of trust establishment in cloud computing. The proposed strategy is based on the principle of "never trust, always verify," and it involves continuous verification of all users, devices, and applications accessing cloud services. The paper also discusses the benefits of establishing trust in cloud services and how it can be achieved.

# Data Privacy in Cloud Computing [ Tolulope Odeyemi - 2214061 ]
Title: Multi-Layer Token Framework for Data Protection in Cloud Computing

Abstract: Cloud computing has become a popular paradigm for delivering computing resources over the internet. However, the shared nature of cloud resources and the lack of control over the underlying infrastructure raise concerns about data privacy and security. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Layer Token Framework for Data Protection in Cloud Computing (MLTF-DP) that provides a comprehensive approach to data protection. The framework consists of multiple layers of tokens that are used to authenticate users, authorize access to resources, and encrypt data. We also present a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Our results show that the MLTF-DP framework can provide strong data protection in cloud computing environments.
