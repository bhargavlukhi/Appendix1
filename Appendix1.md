# Zero Trust Security in Cloud Computing [ Khyati Parmar - 2308312 ]
   Title: Establishing a Zero Trust Strategy in Cloud Computing Environment
   Authors: S. S. S. Sowmya, K. S. Easwarakumar, and S. S. Sreeja
   Affiliations: Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Amrita School of Engineering, Coimbatore, India
   Abstract: Cloud computing has become an essential technology for businesses and organizations to store, process, and manage data. However, security and     privacy challenges have emerged as major concerns in cloud computing. Traditional trust management mechanisms are no longer sufficient to address these     challenges. This paper proposes a conceptual zero trust strategy for cloud services, exploring the importance and challenges of trust establishment in      cloud computing. The proposed strategy is based on the principle of "never trust, always verify," and it involves continuous verification of all users,     devices, and applications accessing cloud services. The paper also discusses the benefits of establishing trust in cloud services and how it can be 
   achieved.

# Data Privacy in Cloud Computing [ Tolulope Odeyemi - 2214061 ]
   Title: Multi-Layer Token Framework for Data Protection in Cloud Computing
   Authors: Muhammad Asif, Muhammad Imran Tariq, and Muhammad Sher
   Affiliations: Department of Computer Science, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan
   Abstract: Cloud computing has become a popular paradigm for delivering computing resources over the internet. However, the shared nature of cloud       
   resources and the lack of control over the underlying infrastructure raise concerns about data privacy and security. In this paper, we propose a Multi- 
   Layer Token Framework for Data Protection in Cloud Computing (MLTF-DP) that provides a comprehensive approach to data protection. The framework consists 
   of multiple layers of tokens that are used to authenticate users, authorize access to resources, and encrypt data. We also present a case study to 
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Our results show that the MLTF-DP framework can provide strong data protection in cloud 
   computing environments.

# Cloud-Native Application Security [ Riddhi Parmar- 1977020 ]
   Title: Cloud-Native Application Security
   Authors: Maxim Chernyshev, Zubair Baig, Sherali Zeadally
   Affiliations: Maxim Chernyshev and Zubair Baig, Deakin University
   Sherali Zeadally, University of Kentucky
   Abstract: Insecure cloud-native applications (CNAs) are at high risk of security breaches due to their dynamic nature and complex threat landscape. We      evaluate current security techniques, their pros and cons in CNAs, and identify future research opportunities. Application and API security compromises     are a leading cause of modern data breaches. Many contemporary applications, often built as cloud-native applications (CNAs) using Microservices and        DevOps methodologies, face a growing array of threats, including automated attacks, DDoS attacks, and exploitation of design and code weaknesses.           Developers can mitigate these risks through secure coding practices, proper configuration, and the integration of robust security measures into their 
   software development lifecycles (SDLCs). Application developers often struggle to strike a balance between speed and security, especially when lacking 
   security expertise. This is further complicated by heavy reliance on open source dependencies, which can make up a substantial portion, up to 80%, of
   the application's codebase in many CNAs.

 # Cloud Security Risks and Management Framework [ Richa Patel- 2185107 ]
   Title: A RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK FOR CLOUD COMPUTING
   Author(s): Feng Xie, Yong Peng, Wei Zhao, Dongqing Chen, Xiaoran Wang, Xingmei Huo
   Affiliation(s): China Information Technology Security Evaluation Center, Beijing 100085, China, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, China
   Abstract: This paper proposes a comprehensive framework consisting of five components to help cloud service providers better understand user 
   requirements and acquire trust. The framework is designed to address the distrust between users and cloud suppliers, and to mitigate security issues        associated with cloud computing. The basic three factors in risk assessment, assets, threats, and vulnerabilities, are demonstrated in the framework. 
   The proposed framework is expected to provide a useful tool for cloud service providers to manage risks and enhance security in cloud computing.
